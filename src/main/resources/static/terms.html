        <p>Welcome to the <strong>Handy Craft Shop</strong>. By browsing our catalog or making a purchase, you are entering into a <strong>commercial agreement</strong> regarding the sale and delivery of artisanal goods. These terms specifically govern your orders, the unique nature of our crochet products, and our return policies to ensure a fair transaction between you and our local Malaysian makers.</p>

        <section class="faq-item">
            <h3>1. The Nature of Handmade Goods</h3>
            <p>Every item on Handy Craft is a unique piece of art handcrafted by independent Malaysian artisans. You acknowledge that slight variations in colorway, stitch tension, and dimensions are inherent characteristics of handmade crochet and are not considered defects.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="faq-item">
            <h3>2. Order Cancellations</h3>
            <p>To respect the artisan’s material preparation and labor time, cancellations for standard orders must be requested within <strong>12 hours</strong> of purchase. After this window, the artisan may have already begun the creation process.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="faq-item">
            <h3>3. Custom Commissions</h3>
            <p>Custom orders are governed by individual timelines agreed upon during consultation. Once work has commenced on a custom piece, deposits and payments are non-refundable due to the personalized nature of the materials and design.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="faq-item">
            <h3>4. Shipping and Delivery</h3>
            <p>Orders are dispatched directly from the artisan's local studio. While we strive for timely delivery, Handy Craft is not liable for delays caused by third-party Malaysian courier services. Risk of loss passes to the customer upon delivery to the carrier.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="faq-item">
            <h3>5. Damage Policy & Returns</h3>
            <p>In accordance with artisanal standards, we do not accept returns for "change of mind." We offer replacements or credits only for items verified as <strong>damaged upon delivery</strong>, provided notice is given to us within <strong>7 days</strong> of receipt.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="faq-item">
            <h3>6. Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the <strong>Laws of Malaysia</strong>. Any disputes relating to these shop terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Malaysian courts.</p>
